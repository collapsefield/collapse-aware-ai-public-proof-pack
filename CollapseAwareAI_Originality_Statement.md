Collapse Aware AI — Original Architecture Declaration

Collapse Aware AI (CAAI) is an original architecture developed by M.R. (Verrell Moss Ross) under Inappropriate Media Limited.
It does not derive from or borrow existing LLM or structured AI systems.
Its bias-weighted, observer-responsive framework is based on Verrell’s Law, which treats field collapse as a memory-biased informational event.

The concepts of “observer responsiveness,” “bias engine,” and “governor logic” were independently originated within the Verrell-Solace research framework (2023-2025).
