## Overview

This repository serves as the **public documentation and evidence pack** for **Collapse-Aware AI (CAAI / collapseaware AI)** — a next-generation bias-governed architecture derived from the theoretical framework known as **Verrell’s Law**.

CAAI is not an LLM or a derivative of existing transformer systems.  
It functions as **model-agnostic middleware**, steering inference in real time through a bias-governor and weighted-moment logic rather than post-training fine-tuning.

The purpose of this repo is to establish authorship, provenance, and public proof of concept.  
No proprietary core or executable code is included here.

## Core Principle

> *Verrell’s Law states that time, memory, and all emergence layers are electromagnetic information fields, continuously collapsing and reforming through observation.  
> Collapse-Aware AI operationalizes this principle in software form.*

The system dynamically regulates probability flow via contextual bias weighting:

- **Recency:** how fresh or temporally local the data is  
- **Salience:** how important or emotionally charged a cue is  
- **Anchors:** persistent reference points or goals  

These factors are processed through the **Governor**, which maintains field coherence during inference and prevents context collapse.
