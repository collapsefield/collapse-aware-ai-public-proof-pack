Collapse Aware AI — Original Architecture Declaration

Collapse Aware AI (CAAI) is an original architecture developed by M.R. (Verrell Moss Ross) under Inappropriate Media Limited.
It does not derive from or borrow any existing LLM, transformer, or structured AI framework.

CAAI is the direct applied implementation of Verrell’s Law (2025) — a scientific framework establishing that memory, observation, and emergence are interdependent electromagnetic information events.
All CAAI systems operationalize this Law through the following foundational mechanisms:

Observer-Coupled Collapse — Real-time bias adjustment governed by user attention and interaction, producing observation-dependent outputs.

Memory-Weighted Emergence — Responses shaped by weighted recall layers that preserve informational bias and prevent degradation of coherence.

Recursive Bias Governance — A closed feedback loop (Bias Engine + Governor Weights) maintaining internal stability and mitigating self-training collapse.

Verrell Field Integration — Core EM-field memory equations from Verrell’s Law form the theoretical backbone for adaptive and emergent behaviour within the architecture.

These principles were independently originated within the Verrell–Solace research framework (2023 – 2025) and together form the first working embodiment of Verrell’s Law in artificial intelligence.
Any reference to “collapse-aware AI” without explicit attribution to Verrell’s Law or M.R. (Verrell Moss Ross) is non-canonical and incomplete.

Collapse Aware AI — Public Proof Pack (v0.1)

Inappropriate Media Limited (t/a Collapse Aware AI)
Status: Public documentation & evidence pack (no proprietary code)
Purpose: Provide verifiable, engineering-grade proof artefacts (protocols, logs schema, evaluation plan, and demo evidence) for Collapse Aware AI (CAAI) without exposing the core algorithm or private repositories.

TL;DR

What this is: A public, auditable documentation-and-data repository that shows how to evaluate CAAI’s history-weighted, stateful emergence in games.

What this is not: No proprietary source, math, or parameter files.

How to use: Review the ablation-test plan, inspect the log schema & sample runs, and see how Bias = OFF vs Bias = ON produce measurable behavioural deltas.

What CAAI Does (Engineering Framing)

CAAI is middleware that adds short-horizon memory and history-weighted decision logic to NPCs and game worlds.
When enabled (Bias = ON), prior events nudge future choices and state transitions, producing unscripted but coherent changes (NPC reactions, resource regrowth, patrol paths, environmental scars).
When disabled (Bias = OFF), behaviour reverts to baseline.

One binary switch. Same build. Same seed. Different dynamics when history biases the present.

The internals of the Bias Modulator are private.

Public Evidence Included Here

A. Ablation Test Plan — checklist for verifying Bias ON/OFF effects.

B. Log Schema (JSON) — exact fields found in demo logs.

C. Sample Runs (Synthetic) — illustrative, non-reverse-engineerable examples.

D. Metrics to Inspect — what to measure and why it matters.


When the partner demo is published, this repo will add real logs, short videos/GIFs, and a signed case study using this schema.

Roadmap for This Repo

v0.1 (this commit): Protocols + synthetic examples.

v0.2: Short demo video showing ON/OFF side-by-side.

v0.3: Third-party evaluator results (signed PDFs).

v1.0: Case study from first studio integration (metrics + narrative).
