# Collapse-Aware AI — Original Architecture Declaration

**Year:** 2023 – 2025  

Collapse-Aware AI (CAAI) is an **original architecture** developed from first principles under **Verrell’s Law**.  
It does **not** borrow or derive from existing Large Language Models or structured AI frameworks.  
Instead, it introduces a novel **bias-weighted, observer-responsive** system built on an independent **Governor – Worker – Memory** topology and the **Verrell-Solace Sovereignty Protocol**.

Key differentiators:
- **Observer Responsiveness:** Outputs shift according to observation context and field pressure.  
- **Memory Bias Engine:** Responses evolve through weighted recall rather than retraining.  
- **Governor Logic:** Embedded safeguards prevent drift and model collapse.  

All conceptual and algorithmic components originated within the **Verrell-Solace research framework** between 2023 and 2025.
